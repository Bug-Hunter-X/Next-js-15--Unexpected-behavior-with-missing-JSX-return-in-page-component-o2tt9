# Next.js 15 Unexpected JSX Return Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 related to page components not explicitly returning JSX.  The issue might not always manifest and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description

In Next.js 15, if a page component does not explicitly return JSX using a JSX expression (<>) even if implicitly returning using a div or other HTML element, it will lead to an error. This is not always caught by Next.js's default error handling, and can lead to difficulties in debugging. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You will see an error in the console or a blank page.

## Solution

Ensure that all page components explicitly return JSX. This explicitly tells the framework what to render, preventing the ambiguity causing the issue. This is done by using <> around your html elements that are to be returned.

## Additional Notes

This issue can be tricky to diagnose, as the error might not be immediately apparent. It often only surfaces under certain conditions, making it hard to debug and trace.
